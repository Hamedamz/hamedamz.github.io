// Hi! I'm an Ph.D student at the University of Southern California, where I work with Jesse Thomason on language grounding and human-robot interaction. I build robots that interact with their environment and other humans, and study how humans percieve their actions.
//
// I was a visiting scholar at Cornell with Tapo Bhattacharjee working on assistive robotics for people with mobility limitations. Previously at UT Austin, I worked on human-robot interaction with the Building-Wide Intelligence Project with Justin Hart and Peter Stone. I also completed an honors thesis with Chandrajit Bajaj.
//
//     I previously interned at Sandia National Labs with the Neural Exploration and Research Lab. Over three years, I had the pleasure of working with James Aimone, Craig Vineyard, and many others!
