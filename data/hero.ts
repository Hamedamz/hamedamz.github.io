    bio: `<p>Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. 
I research localization of UAV swarms at <a class="link" href="https://www.flslab.org/" target="_blank">Flying Light Specks (FLS) Lab</a>
 supervised by <a class="link" href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ghandeharizadeh/Shahram" target="_blank">Shahram Ghandeharizadeh</a>.
 I design decentralized algorithms for drones to create 3D illuminations, and build drone prototypes with lighting and vision capabilities. My research focuses on decentralized localization and tracking for collaborative robots.</p>`
